# Public Readiness Scrub Record

Status: PUBLIC-READINESS-CANDIDATE / OWNER-VISIBILITY-ACTION-REQUIRED

This repository is being prepared as a candidate for public visibility under `SV-ACTIONS-COST-PUBLIC-EXPOSURE-001`.

## Scrub performed

On 2026-09-14, the repository was included in bounded GitHub code searches for:

- credential and secret markers: password, token, secret, private_key, api_key, credential, wallet, seed, mnemonic, OpenAI/GitHub token markers;
- personal/private data markers: owner/family names, address/phone/SSN/VA/medical/bank/Coinbase/iCloud/Personal-KV/SKAP markers;
- internal warning markers: PRIVATE, PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL, INTERNAL, TODO/FIXME/HACK with secret/credential terms.

No matching search results were returned for this repository in that bounded scan.

## Additional public-readiness observation

The legacy `bridge-openai.yml` direct-provider bridge is already contained as manual dispatch only and fails closed instead of processing third-party provider credentials.

## Readiness conditions

- Repository visibility has not been changed by automation.
- Owner must make the final visibility change.
- Any future addition of credentials, personal data, resident runtime state, private KV/SKAP content, or unpublished implementation evidence must keep that content out of public history.
- GitHub Actions must remain validation/evidence transport only and must not claim runtime, credential, Interlock/InTr, WorkerCoordinator, or Master Records authority.

## Current recommendation

Public-ready candidate after this PR is merged, subject to owner confirmation and no new sensitive-content findings before the visibility change.
